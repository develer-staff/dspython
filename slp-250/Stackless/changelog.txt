20020524	ct	There appears to be a problem with stack switching
			and tkinter. When I disable it, things work. This is
			most probably a stack misuse with C locals used as
			globals. This gives a problem when squirreled away...
			Should we possibly disable stack manips completely
			by default and have the user switch it on?

20020524	ct	There have been massive changes in thee meantime, and
			I've missed logging them in the changelog.
			This will become better now.
			The old ideas of reusing old stackless stuff are gone.
			There is now always "hardware" switching of tasklets.
			Also, Limbo like channels have been introduced, which
			give us a very simple multitasking.

200203 to	ct	Thinking, thinking and reading. Alef, Limbo, Occam.
200205		Got hired by IronPort for working on Stackless and
			their application based upon it.

20020122	ct	There are some influences of olde Stackless. Without repeating
			the full mess, a number of ideas are very useful
			Especially, the frame dispatcher idea will be revived.
			It turns out to make sense:
			Try to let the innermost interpreter resolve some recusrions.
			Find an equivalent of olde Py_UnwindToken. Probably the 
			protocol of the new generators can be extended.
			Now I *do* think to modify frames. They get an additional
			field for their C stack part.
			There will definately be a revival of f_execute.
			This fits perfectly: For pure frames, this is eval_frame.
			For frames which need to restore their stack, it will be a helper
			function.
			I can see the light :-)

20020121	ct	Initial setup, first Stackless version (without functionality yet)
