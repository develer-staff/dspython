This is a port of the OpenSteer Library to Python
http://opensteer.sourceforge.net

The aim is to have the Steertest application of the library
based on Stackless Python to provide a testbed for 
agent simulation

It's not finished yet and still work in progress so 
you should leave it right now and wait until the code is polished.
Hope to finish a first working release in the next days.

After that i will integrate stackless specific features
and optimize the code. 
Actors will be implemented as Stackless Tasklets.
